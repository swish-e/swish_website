            GoSwish is a cgi-bin front-end to Swish-e, for use on
            OS/2 web servers. It uses Swish-e 1.3.1 (as ported by
            Chris McRae). GoSwish provides a web-based method of

            <ul>
                <li>specifying and generating Swish-e indices,
                and</li>

                <li>searching these indices using a simple html
                form.</li>
            </ul>and it does this with out requiring any knowledge
            of Swish-e (though knowledge of Swish-e will help users
            optimize their indices).

        <dd>Swish.jsp uses Swish-e to dynamically generate XML from
        the search executed on the indexes. When executing a
        search, the application will create the XML structure based
        on the search parameters which are set in the config file.
        It can be used as a generic search engine for any web site
        since it is fully configurable.</dd>
