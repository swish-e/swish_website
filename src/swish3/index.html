<h3>Features planned for 3.0</h3>

<p>
Swish-e 3.0 (abbreviated Swish3) will be a complete overhaul of the code.
You can <a href="http://dev.swish-e.org/wiki/swish3">track development progress here</a>.
Major feature improvements will include:

<dl>
 <dt>Unicode support</dt>
 <dd>Unicode is the <a href='http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/'>international standard 
 for character encodings</a>. Swish3 will implement
 support for the <a href='http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html'>UTF-8</a>
 <a href='http://czyborra.com/utf/'>character encoding</a>,
 which should handle all major languages in the world (UTF-8 handles up to 
 2,147,483,648 unique characters).
 The Swish-e developers need input from non-English language experts. 
 Please contribute to the discussion at the
  
  [% link_to_page('discuss' , 'Swish-e mailing list' ) %].
  
 Some significant known issues include:
 <p />
 <dl>
  <dt>lowercase vs. UPPERCASE</dt>
  <dd>Version 2.x uses <tt>tolower()</tt> to lowercase all characters
  before searching and indexing. Should the same approach be used for UTF-8? Will this have
  significant impact on usability for non-English languages? 
  </dd>
  <dt>Wildcards</dt>
  <dd>Version 2.x uses an internal table to support wildcard searching with <tt>*</tt>.
  The table assumes 8-bit (non-Unicode) character encoding. That approach will likely need
  to be re-thought for multibyte encodings like UTF-8.
  </dd>
  <dt>Tokenizing</dt>
  <dd>Version 2.x uses 5 different configuration options to control how a 
  'word' (token) is defined. The basic assumption is that a word is defined by which characters it
  <i>includes</i>. That assumption is based on a manageable character set of 256 characters.
  However, the sheer size of UTF-8 makes that system unworkable. Instead, some kind of
  regular expression library will likely be used.
  </dd>
  
  <dt>Stemming</dt><dd>The stemmers used will need full international support.
  </dd>
  <dt>Configuration format</dt>
  <dd>Since Swish-e depends on a configuration file for StopWords, Character
  definitions, etc., the parsing of the configuration file must support UTF-8 as well.
  The current idea is to switch to XML-style configuration files and use Libxml2 to parse
  them.
  </dd>
 </dl>
 
 </dd>

 <dt>Incremental indexing</dt>
 <dd>Swish3 will support true incremental indexing. This will allow for document records
 to be modified, added and deleted in an existing index. This feature may or may not build
 on the version 2.x experimental btree/incremental feature.
 </dd>
 
 <dt>Scaling</dt>
 <dd>Swish3 will reliably scale to larger (multimillion) document collections.
 </dd>
 
 <dt>Indexing API</dt>
 <dd>Swish3 will include an indexing API in addition to the current searching API.</dd>
 
 <dt>Streamlined feature set</dt>
 <dd>Swish3 will not contain several features in the current version:
 <ul>
  <li>Expat parsers</li>
  <li><tt>-S http</tt> indexing method and related configuration options</li>
  <li>Older stemmers</li>
  <li>Current native index format</li>
 </ul>
 </dd>
 
 <dt>Alternate index backends</dt>
 <dd>Swish3 will offer alternate index backends using available open source libraries,
 such as <a href='http://xapian.org/'>Xapian</a>, 
 <a href='http://hyperestraier.sourceforge.net/'>HyperEstraier</a>,
 <a href='http://incubator.apache.org/lucene4c/'>Lucene</a>, or 
 <a href='http://www.lemurproject.org/'>Lemur</a>.
