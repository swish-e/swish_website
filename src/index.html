<i>What a bloody fantastic tool.

<br />
I went from seeing it mentioned in a link on the hypermail website, 
to downloading, installing, configuring, integrating the PHP, 
setting up the cron jobs and having it all working within the hour.

<br/>
Now that's how good software is meant to integrate.

<!-- about swish-e: the marketing blurb -->

<h1 id="about">About Swish-e</h1>
    <p>
      Swish-e is a fast, flexible, and free open source system for indexing collections of Web pages or other files.
      Swish-e is ideally suited for collections of a million documents or smaller. Using the GNOME&trade; libxml2
      parser and a collection of filters, Swish-e can index plain text, e-mail, PDF, HTML, XML, Microsoft&reg; Word/PowerPoint/Excel
      and just about any file that can be converted to XML or HTML text. Swish-e is also often used to supplement databases like the
      MySQL&reg; DBMS for very fast full-text searching.
