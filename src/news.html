<h3>May 4, 2004 - Swish-e at USENIX and YAPC::NA</h3>

<p>
Josh Rabinowitz made a <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix04/tech/sigs.html/">presentation</a>
about Swish-e at this
summer's <a href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix04/">USENIX Annual Technical Conference</a>
in Boston on July 1st,
and <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/talk_desc.shtml#26">also</a> at the
<a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/">Yet Another Perl Conference</a> in Buffalo, New York on
June 18th.
</p>

<p>
From Josh's talk description:
"Perl's text handling prowess coupled with Swish-e's special features
and perl API provide a substantial and robust system upon which to
build searching systems. In this talk we'll cover Swish-e core
concepts and we'll also discuss non-trivial real world examples
including Sman, a real-world open source project that uses Swish-e
and perl to provide an enhanced version of 'man -k' and 'apropos'
(see <a href='http://joshr.com/src/sman/'>http://joshr.com/src/sman/</a>, it will likely appear on CPAN before
long), and 'swished', a mod_perl-based concurrent and persistent
swish-e server written by Josh and to be open sourced around the time
of conference. Such a server has long been on the Swish-e "to do"
list. We'll also compare MySQL4's Full Text Search with Swish-e
indices interms of features and performance, with graphs of the
relative responsetime for the two indexing mechanisms when tested
under various size indices, queries, and numbers of concurrent
searches." More info on the talks can be found here:
