    <h1>E-mail Discussion List</h1>

    <p>The <strong>Swish-e</strong> e-mail list is for the
    discussion of the Swish-e software and its implementation and
    use. Bug fixes, problem reports, desired features, and more are
    all appropriate topics.</p>

    <p>Read [%
            
    link_to_page('install#when_posting_please_provide_the_following_information_',
    'these important tips') %] if you want effective and speedy
    help.</p>

    <p>The list is low traffic. A few messages a week, and
    sometimes a few a day. If you plan on using Swish-e you really
    should join the list. Email sent directly to developers will
    likely be ignored.</p>

    <p>A Boolean "and" between words is assumed; that is, documents
    will be retrieved that have <b>all</b> the specified words. If
    you wish to find all the documents that have <b>any</b> word,
    then use "or" between your search words. To truncate a word,
    use an asterisk (*) at the end. For example, the search
    "comput*" would retrieve documents that have the words
    "computer", "computing", "computation", etc. Search capability
    is being provided by <a href="http://swish-e.org/">Swish-e</a>,
    what else?</p>

    <h3>Posting Policy</h3>

    <p>The following policy governs all postings to the Swish-e
    list. Offenders will be warned once and removed from the list
    after a second violation of the same policy:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>All messages must relate to Swish-enhanced or issues
        related to the development or implementation of it.</li>

        <li>Advertisements are not appropriate. However, a simple
        statement that offers a way to follow-up for more
        information on a service or product is tolerated if it
        accompanies a substantive message discussing a subject
        appropriate to the list.</li>

        <li>Personal attacks such as name calling and personal
        insults will not be tolerated. Comments that are intended
        only to enrage the recipient rather than contribute to
        thoughtful discussion are prohibited.</li>

        <li>All postings must be free of copyright restrictions
        that limit distribution. For example, posting a significant
        amount of a copyrighted work verbatim requires the
        permission of the copyright holder. To verify that such
        permission was obtained, all postings of this nature must
        include a statement that this is the case.</li>
    </ol>
