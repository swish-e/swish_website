        <dd>Swish.jsp uses Swish-e to dynamically generate XML from
        the search executed on the indexes. When executing a
        search, the application will create the XML structure based
        on the search parameters which are set in the config file.
        It can be used as a generic search engine for any web site
        since it is fully configurable.</dd>

	<dd>Swishd cluster system is an application that will allow Swish-e to scale 
	out to multiple machines, thus allowing the number of indexes (or collections)
	 to become almost limitless. By scaling out to multiple swishd nodes the index 
	sizes can remain small as the number of documents increase. This it typically 
	measured in millions of documents/files.</dd>
